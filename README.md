# Predictive Maintenance in R
The purpose of the project is to build a classification model using the 'Predictive maintenance' dataset, which consists of 10 000 data points stored as rows with 8 features in columns. The classifier will have to be able to predict the target variable, which takes value '0' if the machine has no failure and therefore no maintenance is needed, '1' if on the contrary, if some kind of damage has been revealed in the machine and it needs maintenance.

The dataset is taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification.

For more detailed information regarding the construction of the model, please read the report at the following link: 'https://github.com/opon13/Predictive-Maintenance-in-R/blob/main/Predictive%20Maintenance:%20project%20explanation.pdf'
